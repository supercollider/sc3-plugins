DESCRIPTION::
Apply focus to a first order ambisonic signal (B-format) along the y-axis.


NOTE::
link::Classes/FoaFocusY:: is usually called via the convenience wrapper link::Classes/FoaTransform::.
::



CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

argument:: in
The B-format signal, an array: [w, x, y, z]

argument:: angle
The distortion angle, in radians. -pi/2 to pi/2

argument:: mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument:: add
This value will be added to the output.

discussion:: Focus is a normalised dominance variant, specified in terms of a distortion angle. Positive values of strong::angle:: maintain gain at code:: [pi/2, 0] ::, while reducing at code:: [-pi/2, 0] ::. Negative values do the inverse. The default, 0, results in no change.

In contrast with zoom, gain is maintained at 0dB in the direction of distortion.
