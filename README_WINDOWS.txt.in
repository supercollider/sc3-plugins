Supercollider ${PROJECT_VERSION} Plugins for Windows
====================================================

Currently there are two releases of sc3-plugins, a 64- and a 32-bit version.
Only the 32-bit release contains the plugin-versions required for SuperNova, the
alternative sound server. There is no 64-bit version of supernova for Windows
yet. Note that you can use the 32-bit version of SC and plugins without
problems on a 64-bit Windows version.

The release used must fit your SuperCollider version. So for 32-bit SuperCollider
download 32-bit sc3-plugins, for 64-bit SC choose 64-bit sc3- plugins. If you
want to use supernova, you can only use the 32-bit version of both SC and
sc3-plugins. SC 32-bit is by default installed to `C:\Program Files (x86)`,
whereas SC 64-bit is installed to `C:\Program Files`. You should see the SC
application folder on SuperCollider startup when the location of the
SCClassLibrary is displayed in the post-window.

This release of sc3-plugins cannot be used with SC 3.6.x, sc3-plugins only work
within the same minor-version ('6' or '7') of SC. If you forgot which SC-version
you use: for the minor version, check the SC menu-entry `Help/About`.

If you want to compile sc3-plugins yourself please consult the general
SuperCollider ReadMe provided with the Windows version.


## Installation

Before installation, please uninstall any previous version of the plugins from
your system. You may want to back the old version up, just in case.

Installing the 64-bit version is a bit different from installing the 32-bit
version.

*Note*: the `include folder` system in the SC-IDE does not support including
binary plugins yet, you need to place the plugins in the `Extensions` folder.

*Note*: the 64-bit release of the sc3-plugins is experimental. Please provide
feedback about your experiences with it in the SC mailing list.


### 64-bit

SCWin-3.7-64 is compiled with Visual Studio 2013/12, whereas the sc3-plugins are
compiled with MinGW 5.3. Therefore the MinGW "runtime libraries" need to be
added to the folder in which `scsynth.exe` resides, i.e. the SuperCollider
*application folder*. The three runtime libraries are bundled with the
sc3-plugins release in a separate zip-file. They need to be extracted and moved
to the SC application folder. This is most likely:

    C:\Program Files\SuperCollider-<sc-version>

The zip-files containing the actual plugins (binaries, class- and help-folders)
can be extracted and moved as is to the SuperCollider *extensions folder*, which
is a folder called `Extensions` in the SC support directory. This folder is
different from the application folder and can be a bit tricky to find because
its grand-parent-folder (`AppData`) is not shown in the File Explorer by
default. You may have to choose `View/Hidden Files` first. On a standard system
the folder should be found here:

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider

The safest way to identify the exact path is to evaluate in SC:

    Platform.userAppSupportDir

If the actual `Extensions`-folder does not exist yet, create it and move the
sc3-plugins folder there. You should end up with a folder structure similar to
this:

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\Extensions\SC3plugins

*Note*: if the MinGW runtime libraries are not moved to the application folder,
or if for some reason wrong versions are used, you will get error-messages like
these when the server is booted:

*** ERROR: LoadLibrary 'C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\Extensions\SC3plugins\BBCut2UGens.scx' err 'The specified module could not be found.
*** ERROR: LoadLibrary 'C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\Extensions\SC3plugins\BetablockerUGens.scx' err 'The specified module could not be found.
...


### 32-bit

Note that the zip-file provided in the release contains two folders: `plugins`
and `sc3-plugins-classes`. The former contains the plugin binaries (*.scx), the
later the class- and help-files. While the name of the later can be changed to
your liking, the binaries must be contained in a folder called `plugins`. This
is a requirement of supernova.

Both folders need to go into the SuperCollider *extensions folder*, which is a
folder called `Extensions` in the SC *support* folder. This folder can be a bit
tricky to find because its grand-parent-folder (`AppData`) is not shown in the
File Explorer by default. You may have to choose `View/Hidden Files` first. On a
standard system the folder should be found here:

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider

The safest way to identify the exact path is to evaluate in SC:

    Platform.userAppSupportDir

If the actual `Extensions`-folder does not exist yet, create it and move the
sc3-plugins folder there. You should end up with a folder structure similar
to this:

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\Extensions\plugins
    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\Extensions\sc3-plugins-classes


*Note*: It should also be possible to install the plugins to:

    Platform.systemAppSupportDir
